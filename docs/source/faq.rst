Frequently asked questions
==========================

#. **Why is the project called wrenfold?** The name is derived by combining
   `wren <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren>`_ (a cute bird) with "fold" - as in manifold, a
   mathematical concept.

#. **Why did you make this?** I work on a mixture of computer vision and state estimation problems.
   The symbolic code-generation workflow is well suited to these domains, and can meaningfully
   improve iteration time for experimenting with new algorithms or parameterizations.
   The `SymForce paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07889>`_ outlines the core concept, but I felt as
   though there were areas that the implementation could be expanded and rendered more powerful.

#. **I found a bug, what should I do?** Please consider
   `filing a bug <https://github.com/wrenfold/wrenfold/issues/new/choose>`_.
